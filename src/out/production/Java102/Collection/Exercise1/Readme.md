Book Sorter

Design a class called Book. Inherit from this class Comparable interface and override the "compareTo" method. Inside this method, write the code that sorts the book by name from A to Z. Create 5 objects of this class and store the objects in a Set type structure. Then use a data structure of the Set type a second time and have it sort the books by the number of pages.

The Book class consists of the book name, number of pages, name of the author, and date of publication
